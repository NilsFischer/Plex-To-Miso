In order for this to work, fill out the required constants in config.php

Once done, you must retrieve your OAuth token and OAuth token secret.
To do so, first generate move miso.php to a web accessible directory. Visit
miso.php, which will retrieve your application token and place it in a file, as
defined by MISO_TOKEN_FILE.

The first string will be your OAuth Token and the second your OAuth Token
secret. Add this to your config.php (MISO_OAUTH_TOKEN, MISO_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)

Ensure you have created your database. The database user will only need SELECT
and INSERT privileges.

You can then run pollPlex.php (either manully or via a cron job).
